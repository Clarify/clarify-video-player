Clarify Video Player
======================

This is a basic search page that uses the Clarify PHP library, available here: https://github.com/Clarify/clarify-php

To use this:

*  Download this package from Github;
*  Rename credentials-dist.php to credentials.php and add your API key;
*  Run `` composer install `` to get the required PHP library;
*  Load this folder in your favorite browser, the URL will be something like: http://localhost/clarify-video-player/
*  Fill in your search terms and hit submit;
*  If you need videos, load what you need from here: http://media.clarify.io/

Note: If there are no search results, the player does not display. We should improve that.
