OP3Nvoice Video Player
======================

This is a proof of concept video player that integrates with the OP3Nvoice search library.

This uses the PHP library available here: https://github.com/Op3nvoice/op3nvoice-php

To use this:

TODO

This can be improved in a number of ways:

*  this only shows the first resulting file, we could extend it to show all of them;
*  the duration should be included in the API call so we don't have to hardcode it here (line 57);
*  if there are no search results, we could display a more useful/friendly message.
